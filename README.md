# Memory Allocation Algorithm Project: Using Brute Force and Greedy Algorithm

## Overview

The memory of a computer is a place where program data is temporarily stored. After the program is finished, program data is freed from the memory.

After freeing the data, 'holes' called internal fragmentation might occur. This 'holes' can cause resource exhaustion.

Therefore, we are designing algorithm with brute force and greedy algorithm to minimize the occurance of internal fragmentation, as well as optimizing memory allocation.
